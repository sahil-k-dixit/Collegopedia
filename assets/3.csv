You need to be very thorough and sure about what you have written in your Resume because most of the questions are asked related to your CV. I was asked to tell about my self, IF I am ready to relocate or no. Also they asked my about my Final year project, you need to know every single thing about your project . I was asked about the future use of my project . They mainly focus on your communication skills and how confident your are while communicating with the person in front of you. In personal interview I was asked about myself and then I asked them a question about their expectations from Me . Sir very well explained me about their expectations and how we will be provided the training. He also told me that depending on my performance Iâ€™ll be appointed a profile and relocation also depends on the same.It was a 10-15 minutes interview."
